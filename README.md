## 🚀 About Me  

I’m a **Computer Science student at Pace University** passionate about developing scalable, secure, and AI-integrated software. My experience spans backend systems, full-stack web applications, and AI-driven automation research.  

Currently, I’m part of the **AI Code Automation Research Team** at Pace University, analyzing how large language models like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Gemini handle end-to-end software development — from 90s video games to modern web apps.  

Alongside research, I’m a **Founding Software Engineer at Lunar Phase**, where I’ve built and deployed a full-stack platform using **Next.js**, **Express/Deno**, and **MongoDB**, with **AWS**, **Docker**, and **NGINX** for cloud infrastructure and deployment.  

I’ve also worked as a **Software Engineer Intern at BZ Marketing**, where I optimized CRM tools and AI-based marketing workflows, and as a **Coding Instructor** at *The Coder School*, helping students bring their first apps and games to life.
